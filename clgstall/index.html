                        <strong>Showcasing Innovation at Ente Keralam Exhibition</strong><br>
                        At the Ente Keralam Exhibition in Kottayam, held to celebrate the Pinarayi Vijayan government's anniversary, our college had the privilege of showcasing our innovative projects and achievements. Among these was my IoT project, the Automated Plant Cultivation System, which garnered significant attention. This system uses a soil moisture sensor to monitor water content and light sensors to regulate sunlight exposure, ensuring optimal plant growth. A built-in display mechanism provides real-time data on light intensity and soil moisture levels, which can also be accessed via a WiFi-enabled webpage. Alongside other remarkable exhibits, our stall stood out as a testament to our creativity and technical expertise.
