                        <strong>Understanding the Phases of Ethical Hacking </strong><br>
                        A key aspect of the seminar was an overview of the five phases of ethical hacking. These phases include reconnaissance, scanning, gaining access, maintaining access, and clearing tracks. Each step was explained to demonstrate how ethical hackers work systematically to identify vulnerabilities in a system, simulating real-world cyberattacks to strengthen defenses. This segment offered the audience a better understanding of how cybersecurity experts think and operate.

                        <strong> Exploring Different Types of Cyberattacks</strong> <br>
                        In addition to ethical hacking, the seminar also shed light on various types of cyberattacks that individuals and organizations face today. Attendees learned about malware, phishing, password attacks, DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, drive-by downloads, malvertising, and rogue software. Each type of attack was illustrated with examples, helping participants grasp their potential impact and the importance of adopting preventive measures.

                        The seminar was well-received by the audience, with active participation and meaningful discussions throughout the session. Attendees were particularly engaged during the interactive segments, where we analyzed examples of phishing emails and explored ways to identify and avoid them. The positive feedback from both students and faculty reinforced the value of the session and highlighted the importance of promoting cybersecurity awareness.
